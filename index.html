        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>The inspiration for this game comes from the fact that I want to create something interesting but not addictive. Being someone that works remotely, it is easy for me to get carried away while trying to engage in other fun activities. When I was reading about viva engage of Microsoft, it dawned on me that most individuals in tech are most times lonely. This is why Microsoft created Viva Engage to help teams bond like they would do on social media. This is why I created this non-addictive but fun game that only keeps you enagaged for a while and then you stop when you feel like. I would have loved to add animation to it, but I discovered that it would defeat the purpose of the game; Non-addictive but fun</p>
